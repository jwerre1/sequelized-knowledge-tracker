As the instructions state, the website's purpose is to "keep track of what topics you have mastered and what ones need work. 

"To add a topic that needs work, simply type it into the box [at the bottom of the screen] and click 'Add'. This will create a button in the appropriate column.

"If you discover later that you did not know a topic as well as you thought you did... Simply click on it again and it will toggle back to the "Needs Work" category."
